# HarvardPH125.9-Capstone-Project-MovieLens

This is the project submission for the HarvardPH125.9 Capstone Project, using the MovieLens dataset in R.

The submission for this project is three files:

1. Report in Rmd format
2. Report in PDF format (knit from Rmd file)
3. A script in R format that generates predicted movie ratings and RMSE score (contains all code and comments for the project)

For this project, we will be creating a movie recommendation system from the MovieLens dataset using all the tools that have been taught throughout the Harvard Data Science courses. All students are instructed to use the 10M version of the MovieLens dataset to make the computation a little easier.

We will download the MovieLens data and run code provided by the course to generate the datasets.

We will train machine learning algorithms using the inputs in one subset to predict movie ratings in the validation set.

This project will be assessed by peer grading.
